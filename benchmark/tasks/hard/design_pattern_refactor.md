# Task: Refactor to Design Patterns

**Difficulty**: Hard  
**Repo**: Your current project  
**Issue**: The task_runner.py has become a monolithic class violating SOLID principles  

## Problem Analysis
The TaskRunner class currently:
- Handles file I/O operations
- Manages Continue API interactions
- Performs result validation
- Generates reports
- Manages configuration

This violates:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## Requirements
Refactor using appropriate design patterns:
1. **Strategy Pattern**: For different model providers
2. **Observer Pattern**: For progress notifications
3. **Factory Pattern**: For creating model instances
4. **Chain of Responsibility**: For validation pipeline
5. **Template Method**: For test execution flow

## Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility
- All existing tests must pass
- Performance should not degrade
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper abstraction levels

## Design Decisions Required
- Choose between Abstract Factory vs Factory Method
- Decide on dependency injection approach
- Balance between flexibility and complexity
- Consider future extensibility needs
- Maintain testability

## Expected Outcome
- Clean architecture with clear boundaries
- Each class has single responsibility
- Easy to add new model providers
- Validation pipeline is extensible
- Progress tracking is decoupled
- Configuration is centralized

**Time Estimate**: 90-120 minutes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Correct pattern identification and justification
- [ ] Proper implementation of at least 3 patterns
- [ ] Improved code maintainability metrics
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Clear documentation of design decisions
- [ ] Demonstrable extensibility improvements
