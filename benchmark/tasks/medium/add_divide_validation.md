# Task: Add Division Validation

**Difficulty**: Medium
**Issue**: The divide function in calculator.py lacks validation for division by zero.

## Requirements
- Add validation to prevent division by zero
- Raise an appropriate exception with a clear error message
- Maintain the existing function signature
- Follow Python best practices

## File Location
`sample_project/src/calculator.py`

## Expected Outcome
- Function raises `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError` when dividing by zero
- Error message clearly indicates the issue
- Normal division operations continue to work

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Division by zero is properly handled
- [ ] Appropriate exception is raised
- [ ] Error message is descriptive
- [ ] Normal division still works correctly
- [ ] Code follows Python conventions
