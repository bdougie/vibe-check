# Task: Implement Test Execution State Machine

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Repo**: Your current project  
**Issue**: Create a state machine to manage complex test execution flows  

## Problem Description
Current test execution is linear and doesn't handle:
- Retries on transient failures
- Pausing and resuming
- Conditional execution paths
- Recovery from errors
- Progress persistence

## Requirements
- Implement a robust state machine for test execution
- Support all required states and transitions
- Handle edge cases and error conditions
- Provide state persistence across restarts
- Include comprehensive logging and debugging
- Support concurrent state machines

## State Machine Details

### States
1. **IDLE**: Initial state, ready to start
2. **PREPARING**: Setting up environment
3. **RUNNING**: Executing test
4. **PAUSED**: Temporarily suspended
5. **RETRYING**: Attempting after failure
6. **VALIDATING**: Checking results
7. **COMPLETED**: Successfully finished
8. **FAILED**: Permanently failed
9. **CANCELLED**: User-terminated

### Transitions
- IDLE → PREPARING: On start command
- PREPARING → RUNNING: Setup complete
- RUNNING → PAUSED: On pause request
- PAUSED → RUNNING: On resume
- RUNNING → VALIDATING: Test complete
- VALIDATING → COMPLETED: Validation passed
- VALIDATING → RETRYING: Validation failed (retry available)
- RETRYING → RUNNING: After delay
- ANY → CANCELLED: On cancel request
- RETRYING → FAILED: Max retries exceeded

## Implementation Requirements
1. State persistence across restarts
2. Event-driven transitions
3. Transition guards/conditions
4. State entry/exit actions
5. Timeout handling
6. State history tracking

## Complex Scenarios
- Pause during retry sequence
- Cancel during validation
- Timeout in preparing state
- Resume after system restart
- Concurrent state machines

## Expected Outcome
- StateMachine class with clean API
- Persistent state storage
- Event emission on transitions
- Visualization of state flow
- Recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging

**Time Estimate**: 45-60 minutes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All states and transitions implemented
- [ ] Guards prevent invalid transitions
- [ ] State persists across restarts
- [ ] Timeout handling works correctly
- [ ] Complex scenarios handled properly
- [ ] Clear state visualization available
