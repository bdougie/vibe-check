# Task: Implement Logic Puzzle Validator

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Repo**: Your current project  
**Issue**: Create a validator that checks if benchmark results are logically consistent  

## Problem Description
Some benchmark results show logical inconsistencies:
- Model A faster than B, B faster than C, but C faster than A
- Success rates that don't match actual task completions
- Timing data that violates causality

## Requirements
Create a validator that:
1. Detects transitive property violations in rankings
2. Identifies statistical impossibilities
3. Checks temporal consistency
4. Validates data integrity

## Logic Rules to Implement
- If A > B and B > C, then A > C (transitivity)
- Total time >= sum of individual task times
- Success rate = successes / total attempts
- Timestamp ordering must be consistent
- File sizes must be non-negative

## Edge Cases to Consider
- Missing data points
- Ties in rankings
- Floating point precision issues
- Concurrent executions
- Clock skew between systems

## Expected Outcome
- Validator class with multiple check methods
- Clear error messages for each violation type
- Suggestions for fixing detected issues
- Report generation for validation results
- Integration with existing pipeline

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Detects all types of logical inconsistencies
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Provides actionable error messages
- [ ] Efficient validation (O(n log n) or better)
- [ ] Well-structured, reusable code
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
